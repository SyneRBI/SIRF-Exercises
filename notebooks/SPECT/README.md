Jupyter notebooks for the SPECT exercises. Recommended order:

## Week 1
1. [SPECT\_acquisition\_model](SPECT_acquisition_model.ipynb) shows how to use `sirf.STIR` with a SPECT projection matrix `SPECTUB` (suitable for parallel beam collimators).
2. [SPECT\_OSEM](SPECT_OSEM.ipynb) shows how to use `sirf.STIR` to run a OSEM reconstruction from simulated data.

## Week 2
1. [SPECT\_OSEM\_measured\_data](SPECT_OSEM_measured_data.ipynb) illustrates OSEM reconstruction with resolution modelling from a NEMA phantom
