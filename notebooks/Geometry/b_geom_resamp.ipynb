    "`sirf.STIR` can also ready NIfTI files, as well as DICOM (at least, if STIR was compiled with ITK support). As STIR internally uses a gantry-based coordinate system, STIR will re-orient images such that the first dimension corresponds to the axial dimension. To do this, it needs to know the patient position. This is available in DICOM data, but unfortunately not for NIfTI. STIR will therefore **assume that NIfTI images correspond to data acquired in *Head First Supine (HSF)* patient position**, as this is the most common case. This doesn't really matter as far as geometry goes (i.e. LPS coordinates will be correct), but does matter when using NIfTI images as input for simulation and reconstruction."
