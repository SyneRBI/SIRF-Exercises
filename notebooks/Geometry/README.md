## Notebooks related to the geometry information in SIRF and NIfTI Files.

If this is the first time using the Notebooks on this VM/Cloud instance, you need to run the `download_data.sh` bash script without the `-h` flag. See the [../Introductory/introduction.ipynb](../Introductory/introduction.ipynb) notebook for details.

[a_geometry.ipynb](a_geometry.ipynb) Introduction to geometry in SIRF and NIfTI

[b_geom_resamp.ipynb](b_geom_resamp.ipynb) Demonstration of use of SIRF for image resampling.

[c_fully3dgeom.ipynb](c_fully3dgeom.ipynb) Demonstration of displaying image in 3D patient-space.

[d_manipulation.ipynb](d_manipulation.ipynb) Demonstration of how to update geometrical information after applying a transformation to the image data.

[get_nifti_data.ipynb](get_nifti_data.ipynb)  Short notebook that shows how to get the data from Zenodo.
