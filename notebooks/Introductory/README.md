# Contents
This directory contains a few basic notebooks to get you going. It is recommended to start with these
before tackling any of the others.

## Basic concepts of object oriented programming
[object\_oriented\_programming](object_oriented_programming.ipynb) is a notebook (independent of SIRF) that
fits with a presentation given by Benjamin A. Thomas for CCP PETMR in 2017.
Please watch the [recording](http://www.ccpsynerbi.ac.uk/sites/www.ccppetmr.ac.uk/files/Introduction_to_OOP_20170728.mp4) (note that screen sharing was enabled after about 4 minutes). You can also 
download the corresponding [slides](http://www.ccpsynerbi.ac.uk/sites/www.ccppetmr.ac.uk/files/20170728_OOP_slides.pdf).

This notebook is not required for being able to use SIRF, but could help with understanding some of the concepts.

## Basic concepts of SIRF via Python
The [introduction](introduction.ipynb) notebook serves as a starting point for all SIRF jupyter notebooks. 
The notebook shows how MR, PET and CT images can be created and manipulated.

The [acquisition_model_mr_pet_ct](acquisition_model_mr_pet_ct.ipynb) notebook shows how to create a MR, PET and CT acquisition model and go from images to raw data and back again for each modality. 

## Learning objectives

- Ensure you have a working version of SIRF (whether you're viewing this via a virtual machine, an Azure instance or a SIRF installation on your own machine).
By the end of these notebooks, you should feel more comfortable with:
- Get a feel for Jupyter notebooks (and the basic python they require)
- Reading and displaying images
- Querying for help to improve knowledge of SIRF functionality.
