    "The STIR `OSMAPOSL` implementation attempts to take care of these subtleties. It of course also avoids overheads such as the divisions with the subsets. Finally, it uses a multi-threaded implementation of the computation of the update that might be a bit faster than using calling the `forward` and `backward` operations directly (although these are multi-threaded as well).\n",
    "\n",
    "When trying to implement an algorithm of a paper, there is often a choice at what \"level\" you choose for your code. In the above, we went to the projector-level. In the [ML_reconstruction notebook](ML_reconstruction.ipynb) we constructed an objective function and used the `update` and `objective_function_value` members to do a lot of the hard work. Similarly, the [MAP_EM notebook](MAP_EM.ipynb) that you could tackle now writes a MAP algorithm in terms of (OS)EM functionality. All choices will probably work ok, but there are various trade-offs between verbosity, flexibility, extendability to consider, but we won't go into that here."
