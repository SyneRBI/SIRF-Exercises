When talking about data recorded by different coils these are also referred to as __channels__ (in the literature it always says something of the kind: \"_... data were acquired using a 32-channel cardiac coil..._\").  \n",

    "This has several advantages, one being that the receiver can be placed very close to the signal (i.e. human). Others we will discuss in the following! \n",
