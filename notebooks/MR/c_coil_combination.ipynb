    "Images from the in-built body coil are rarely used diagnostically. Instead what is used are so-called __receiver coils__, aka \"coils\", or somethimes refered to as __phased arrays__. When talking about data recorded by different coils these are also referred to as __channels__ (in the literature it always says something of the kind: \"_... data were acquired using a 32-channel cardiac coil..._\").  \n",
    "\n",
    "This has several advantages, one being that the receiver can be placed very close to the signal source. Others we will discuss in the following! \n",
