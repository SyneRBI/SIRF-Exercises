Commonly in imaging we think of motion artefacts mainly as blurring, but in MRI motion artefacts depend of course on the type of motion but also on the k-space sampling and the timing. Motion in MRI can lead to blurring but also ghosting (similar to Cartesian undersampling) or streaking or ....\n",
