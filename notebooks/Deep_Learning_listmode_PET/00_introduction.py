# 1. What is listmode PET reconstruction and why is it attractive for combining DL and reconstruction.
# 2. Basic building blocks / architectues of unrolled reconstruction networks.
# 3. Essential blocks of training a neural network in pytorch (model setup, data loading, gradient backpropagation)
#    and what we are missing from pytorch to build an unrolled PET reconstruction network.
