# SIRF-Exercises

This material is intended to get you going with
[SIRF](https://github.com/SyneRBI/SIRF/wiki/Software-Documentation),
an open source framework for PET, SPECT and MR Image Reconstruction, including synergistic aspects.

This repository also contains some exercises using [CIL](https://www.ccpi.ac.uk/CIL), including basic functionality
to show similarities with SIRF and how to use CIL's optimisation algorithms for synergistic reconstruction.

This software is distributed under an open source license, see [LICENSE.txt](LICENSE.txt)
for details.

# Links to documentation

Full instructions on getting started are in our [documentation for participants](DocForParticipants.md)
(or use [this link to GitHub](https://github.com/SyneRBI/SIRF-Exercises/blob/master/DocForParticipants.md)
for nice formatting, but do check which version of the exercises you are using). Despite the name,
this documentation is also appropriate if you are trying these exercises on your own.  
*Gentle request*:
If you are attending a course, ***please read this before the course.*** 

Instructors should check our [documentation for instructors](https://github.com/SyneRBI/SIRF-Exercises/blob/master/DocForInstructors.md).

Installation instructions when you do not use our cloud resources are in [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md), but read the above links first.

You can run the SIRF-Exercises in GitHub Codespaces, see [the section in the documentation](DocForParticipants.md#using-github-codespaces), including information on which kernel to select (and more!).
