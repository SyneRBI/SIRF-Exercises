# SIRF-Exercises

This material is intended for practical demonstrations using 
[SIRF](https://github.com/SyneRBI/SIRF/wiki/Software-Documentation) on PET, SPECT and MR Image Reconstruction, including synergistic aspects.

This repository contains exercises to get you going
with SIRF. 
There is also some basic information on [CIL](https://www.ccpi.ac.uk/CIL) functionality to show similarities with SIRF.
